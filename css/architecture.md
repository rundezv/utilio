# Architecture

- [Yandex/**BEM**](https://en.bem.info) - BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.

- [JonathanSnook/**SMACSS**](https://smacss.com) - SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. There is no library within here for you to download or install. There is no git repository for you to clone. SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process. It is an attempt to document a consistent approach to site development when using CSS.  
- [suitcss/**suit**](https://github.com/suitcss/suit) - Style tools for UI components.

- [kagankan/**ABC-CSS**](https://github.com/kagankan/zenn-articles/blob/master/articles/css-alphabetical-layers-css.md) - As its name suggests, the biggest feature is that when layer names are sorted alphabetically (ABC order), the order matches the sequence in which styles should be applied. It is designed by choosing words so that items with a wide impact and low specificity (which should be kept low) come first, and items with a narrow scope and high specificity come later. This makes it easier to visualize the application order from the Explorer view when developing with separated directories.
